# Next Steps

This file provides a high-level overview of the current development focus.

## Current Focus

The primary focus has shifted to implementing the **Call Hierarchy** feature for `/restEndpoint`. We are taking an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach to get this working end-to-end.

*   **Previous Task (Endpoint Disambiguation):** While the initial implementation of endpoint disambiguation seems to handle simple cases, we will revisit further enhancements after the MVP for call hierarchy is established.
*   **Current Top Priority:** Design and implement the call hierarchy determination for a selected endpoint.
*   **Detailed Status & Plan:** See `docs/rest_endpoint_feature.md` (this document may also need updates to reflect the new priority).

## Guiding Principles
