## Next Steps

All current high-priority tasks and bugs have been addressed. The E2E tests are passing.

Future considerations could involve:
- Enhancing diagram customization options.
- Expanding endpoint discovery to support more frameworks/languages.
- Performance optimizations for very large codebases or complex call hierarchies.
- Adding more diagram types (e.g., component diagrams, deployment diagrams).
- Refine `/restEndpoint` sequence diagram details (e.g., more accurate response representation, improved participant naming).
