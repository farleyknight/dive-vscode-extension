## Next Steps

All current high-priority tasks and bugs have been addressed. The E2E tests are passing.

Future considerations could involve:
- Enhancing diagram customization options.
- Expanding endpoint discovery to support more frameworks/languages.
- Performance optimizations for very large codebases or complex call hierarchies.
- Adding more diagram types (e.g., component diagrams, deployment diagrams).
- Refine `/restEndpoint` sequence diagram details (e.g., more accurate response representation, improved participant naming).
- Implement package-based filtering for sequence diagrams to focus on project-specific code:
    - Add a helper function `getPackageNameFromVscodeItem(item: ICallHierarchyItem)` to reliably extract package names from `item.detail` (e.g., from `com.example.testfixture.TestService` extract `com.example.testfixture`, from `java.util.ArrayList` extract `java.util`, and handle default packages).
    - In the main diagram generation logic (e.g., `generateMermaidSequenceDiagram`), dynamically determine a list of `projectPackagesToInclude`. This could initially be derived from the package of the `rootNode` of the call hierarchy.
    - Pass the `projectPackagesToInclude` list to recursive diagram building functions (e.g., `buildDiagramRecursive`).
    - Within the recursive function, before processing a call to a child node, extract the child's package name.
    - If `projectPackagesToInclude` is set, only include the child call (and its subsequent calls) if its package name starts with one of the entries in `projectPackagesToInclude` (or matches exactly for default package scenarios). This will filter out calls to external libraries or non-project packages.
